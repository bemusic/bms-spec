BMSpec
======

This project aims to create an executable specification of BMS (Be-Music Source)
file format, intended for use in rhythm action games.

See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/bemusic/bmspec).

__Disclaimer:__ This is NOT the official BMS specification. This project aims
to specify the BMS file format in a way that can be automatically tested.
